# Sean Connery Movie Quotes Quiz
    A quiz game created as a tribute to Sir Thomas Sean Connery for his great perfomances on the big screen.
    The goal is to connect a quote, made by a Sean Connery movie character, to the corresponding film title from where the quote was taken.
    Points is given for each correct answer.

## UX
*   For all Sean connery fans, as well as others, this quiz was made to recall the brilliant actor that he was,
    and, for just a moment...in our minds, hear that strong scottich accent with the so characteristic sh-sounds.
    And, of courshe (sorry, just couldn't resist), to enjoy a the pleasure of a simple (sometimes perhaps difficult) quiz game.

*   The expected user would be interested in movies in general and of Sean Connery in particular.

*   By trying to select the corresponding film title to the displayed character quote, 
    the user will, in his/her mind, get to recall and experience that perticular sequence of the movie,
    and therefor inhence their memory of the fallen star. 

*   With the help of Restart button on the End Page the user can re experience the quotes and the actor as many times as they like.

*   The overall colour theme for this site will be black due to the memorial aspect.
    A soft, dark red screen curtain as background together with a gold colour is then added for cinematic effect.
    The red and green is neccesary to emphasize incorrect and correct answer.

    The pictures are chosen with the intention of presenting the actor with the grace and respect that he deserves.

## Features

*   When entering the site a landing page is displayed. It consists of a respectful picture of Mr. Connery,
    a brief description of what to do, and a Start Quiz button.
    
    Clicking the button the user will be presented with a quote from a motion picture
    in which Sean Connery had an acting roll.
    There will be four clickable buttons, each containing a film title.
    The user will select and click on one of the buttons/titles.
    If the correct button/title was clicked, the button will light up green and a point will be added to the score.
    The quiz will then proceed to the next quote.
    If the incorrect button/title was clicked, the button will light up red and no point will be added to score.
    The quiz will then proceed to the next quote.
    A qoute counter is displayed, so the user can follow the progress of the quiz.
    The score counter will update after each quote to give the user the current amount of correct answers.
    
    When the user has reached the final quote of the quiz the user will be directed to an end page
    where the final score will be presented together with a Restart Quiz button.
    Clicking the Restart Quiz button will take the user back to the game board.

### Features Left to Implement
*   A form where the users can contribute to the quiz with additional quotes of thier own choise.

## Technologies Used
*In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries,*
*and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name,*
*a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.*

## Testing
*In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately*
*believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories*
*from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward*
*way for the users to achieve their goals.*

*Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach,*
*link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

*For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant.*
*A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

*Contact form:*
*Go to the "Contact Us" page*
*Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
*Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
*Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
*In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

*You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing,*
*even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

*If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*

## Deployment


*   I have deployed my website on Github to make it accessible to the public.

    *   select none
    *   select main (previously master) branch, Root
    *   click Save
    *   Wait for the page to refresh
    *   scroll down to Github Pages once more
    *   Find Site URL and copy it.
