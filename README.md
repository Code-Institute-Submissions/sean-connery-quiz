# Sean Connery Movie Quotes Quiz

*   A quiz game created as a tribute to Sir Thomas Sean Connery for his great perfomances on the big screen.
    The goal is to connect a quote, made by a Sean Connery movie character, to the corresponding film title from where the quote was taken.
    Points are given for each correct answer.

## UX

*   To all Sean connery fans, as well as others, this quiz was made to help us remember the brilliant actor that he was,
    and, for just a moment...in our minds, recall that pernounced accent with his so characteristic sh-sounds.
    And, of courshe (sorry, just couldn't resist), to enjoy a the pleasure of a simple (yet sometimes difficult) quiz game.

*   The expected user would be interested in movies in general and of Sean Connery in particular.

*   By trying to select the corresponding film title to the displayed character quote, 
    the user will, in his/her mind, get to recall and experience that particular sequence of the picture,
    and therefor inhence their memory of the late star.

*   The user would want clear instructions of what to do and how to navigate in the application.
    Therefore, a short but distinct description of what the quiz is about will be displayed on the landing page.
    The clearly defined buttons will then guide the user to achieve his/her goal.

*   If there is a delay when the Game Board is being loaded, the user would want to know what to expect.
    An animated "loader" is displayed to let the user know that the page is loading.

*   When the user has selected a film title, she/he would expect a confirmation of wether or not the selection was correct.
    The color of film title buttons will respond to the selection.

*   The user would want to know the progress of the quiz and how many quotes there are left to be displayed. 
    A quote counter is displayed for that purpose at the top of the page.

*   The user would want to know when the quiz is over.
    When the last quote has been used the user is directed to the End Page.

*   The user would want to be able to see the amount of correct answers.
    The progress of the score is displayed at the top of the page.

*   At the end of the quiz the user would want to know the total score.
    The total score is displayed on the End Page when the final quote has been answered.

*   Having finished the quiz, the user would want to be given the options of exiting the quiz or try again.
    The user can go back to the Landing Page by clicking the Exit Cinema button, or click the Restart Quiz button to try the quiz again. 

*   The user would want to feel the connection to the cinema and the motion pictures.
    A red cinema screen curtain and content in gold colour, all set on a dark background will provide a cinematic effect.

*   The aim is toward a neat and cinematic design, with the focus upon the quiz game and the character's quotes.

## Technologies Used
    *In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries,*
    *and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name,*
    *a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.*

## Testing
    *In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately*
    *believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories*
    *from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward*
    *way for the users to achieve their goals.*

    *Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach,*
    *link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

    *For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant.*
    *A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

    *Contact form:*
    *Go to the "Contact Us" page*
    *Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
    *Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
    *Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
    *In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

    *You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing,*
    *even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

    *If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*

## Deployment


    *   I have deployed my website on Github to make it accessible to the public.

        *   select main (previously master) branch, Root
        *   click Save
        *   Wait for the page to refresh
        *   scroll down to Github Pages once more
